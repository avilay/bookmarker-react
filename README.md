# Bookmarker

This repo consists of potentially four sub-repos -
  * `bookmarker-static`
  * `bookmarker-webapp`
  * `bookmarker-gql`
  * `bookmarker-gql-server`

## `bookmarker-static`
This is a bunch of static HTML pages to get a sense of how the website will look. It is built using the `skeleton` CSS framework and uses mock data. To start the website:
```
cd bookmarker-static
python -m http.server
```
